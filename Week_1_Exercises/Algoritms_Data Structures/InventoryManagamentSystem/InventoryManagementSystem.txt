1. Understand the Problem
Q. Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential in Handling Large Inventories?
Data structures and algorithms are crucial in handling large inventories because:
•	They determine the efficiency of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
•	The right data structure can optimize the speed and performance of the system, especially when dealing with large datasets.
•	Algorithms ensure that operations like searching, sorting, and updating are performed efficiently.

Q.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Suitable Data Structures
•	HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations.
•	ArrayList: Suitable for scenarios where order matters and the number of elements is relatively small, but has O(n) complexity for search operations.

4. Analysis
    Q.Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
=>Time Complexity of Each Operation
1.Add Product: O(1) - Insertion in a HashMap is generally constant time.
2.Update Product: O(1) - Updating a value in a HashMap is also constant time.
3.Delete Product: O(1) - Removing an entry from a HashMap is constant time.

Q.Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
=>Optimizing Operations
1.Batch Processing: For bulk updates or inserts, consider batch processing to reduce the overhead of multiple individual operations.
2.Concurrency: Use concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap if the inventory management system needs to handle simultaneous read/write operations by multiple threads.
3.Indexing: If search operations on non-key attributes (e.g., productName) become frequent, consider adding indexing mechanisms or secondary data structures to support faster lookups.
