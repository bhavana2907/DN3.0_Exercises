Step 1: Understand Asymptotic Notation

Big O Notation
Definition: Big O notation describes the upper limit of the time complexity of an algorithm. It gives an idea of how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
Purpose: Helps in comparing the efficiency of different algorithms by focusing on their growth rates.
Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios

Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations (e.g., finding the element on the first try).
Average Case: The scenario representing the expected number of operations, considering all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations (e.g., searching through the entire array).

Step 4: Analysis

Time Complexity:
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) (The element is at the first position)
Average Case: O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n) (The element is in the middle)
Worst Case: O(n) (The element is at the last position or not present)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) (The element is at the middle position in the first check)
Average Case: O(log n) (The array is divided in half each time)
Worst Case: O(log n) (The element is in the last possible position after log n divisions)
